    <p>Artisan is an open-source software that helps coffee roasters record, analyze, and control roast profiles. This software can automate the creation of roasting metrics to help make decisions that influence the final coffee flavor.</p>

    <p>Notable features</p>
    <ul>
      <li>we believe in Open-Source, check out our code and contribute</li>
      <li>seamless integration into the artisan.plus inventory management service</li>
      <li>extensive machine and device support including control</li>
      <li>unlimited number of curves</li>
      <li>rate-of-rise (RoR), area-under-the-curve (AUC), development-time-ratio (DTR) calculations and projection lines</li>
      <li>statistics, roast profile evaluation, Profile Analyzerg, Roast Comparatorg, Profile Transposerg and Roast Simulatorg</li>
      <li>roast-, production- and ranking reportsg</li>
      <li>automated reproduction of roasts via alarm programsg, replay of eventsg or PID controlg</li>
      <li>batch counterg</li>
      <li>profile designerg, cupping editor, spider- and wheel graph</li>
      <li>user defined buttons and slidersg with programmable actions</li>
